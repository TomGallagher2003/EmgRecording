"""Signal filtering utilities for EMG/EEG data.

This module provides reusable Butterworth filters for high-pass,
low-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filtering, along with a preprocessing
pipeline tailored for EEG signals that applies a high-pass, notch filters
to remove line noise, and a low-pass cutoff.

Default sampling frequency is 500 Hz.
